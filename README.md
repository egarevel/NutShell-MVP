## 🧠 What It Does

NutShell turns every Chrome tab into an **AI workspace that chats, summarizes, and connects insights across pages**. It helps you understand faster and stay organized while switching back and forth between tabs — all processed **100% locally on your device**.

Unlike cloud-based AI assistants that require constant copy-pasting and raise privacy concerns, **NutShell is your thinking companion** that operates entirely within your browser, understanding your research flow and adapting to how you explore the web.

## 💡 The Problem We're Solving

We've all been there:

- **🗂️ Tab Chaos**: 30+ tabs open, can't remember which had the pricing info
- **📋 Copy-Paste Hell**: Constantly switching between browser and external AI tools
- **🔍 Lost Context**: "What was I researching 20 minutes ago?"
- **🔒 Privacy Concerns**: Sending sensitive queries to cloud services
- **💰 Usage Limits**: Hit API quotas on paid AI services
- **📶 Offline Struggles**: Need internet for every AI query

**I often found myself opening countless tabs, copying snippets, and losing track of what I was searching a while ago. I wanted a browser that could actually think with me — not just show me pages.**

NutShell solves this by bringing AI **into the browser itself**, making every tab a thinking workspace.

## 🌟 Core Features

### 1. 🧠 **Session Recall — Your Research Never Dies**

**The Innovation:** NutShell remembers everything for you.

Come back after hours, days, or weeks — your AI companion greets you with an intelligent recap:

> **"Welcome back! 3 hours ago, you were comparing noise-cancelling headphones. You asked 5 questions about battery life and narrowed down to Sony XM5 vs Bose QC45. Want to continue?"**

**How It Works:**
- **AI-Powered Recaps**: Gemini Nano generates concise "at-a-glance" summaries of what you wanted and recent discoveries
- **Visual Timeline**: See your research journey across tabs and sessions
- **One-Click Resume**: Pick up exactly where you left off — questions, context, everything restored
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Your browser learns your research patterns over time

**Why It Matters:**
- **No More "Wait, What Was I Doing?"**: Instant context restoration after interruptions
- **Research Continuity**: Build knowledge over days without losing threads
- **Cognitive Offloading**: Let NutShell remember details while you think big picture

**100% Local:** Your entire research history stays on your device. Private. Secure. Forever.

## ❓ FAQ

**"Is this really free forever?"**  
Yes! No servers = no costs. Powered by Chrome's built-in AI.

**"How is this different from cloud AI assistants?"**  
NutShell lives IN your browser, sees your tabs, and processes everything locally. Cloud AI assistants require copy-pasting and send data to servers.

**"Does this work offline?"**  
Yes! Once pages are loaded, all AI processing works offline.

**"Is my data shared with Google?"**  
No. All processing happens on YOUR device. Even Google doesn't see your queries.

**"Can I use this on mobile?"**  
Not yet. Chrome AI is currently desktop-only. Mobile support coming from Google soon!

**"When will this be on Chrome Web Store?"**  
Once Chrome AI exits Origin Trial and becomes generally available (estimated mid-2025).

**"Can I trust this with sensitive research?"**  
Absolutely. 100% local processing means your research never leaves your device. Perfect for confidential work, personal health research, financial planning, etc.
